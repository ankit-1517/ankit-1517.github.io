- Learned Indexes were proposed to improve performace of the conventional database indexes
- We propose alternative hybrid engines, spefically for spatial data, to boost performance of classical indexesatibility and responsiveness
- Proposed using Interpolation-Friendly R-Tree, KD-Tree, Quad-Tree and Oc-Tree instead of conventional structures
- Reduced query execution time by 60% while simultaneously shrinking the indexâ€™s memory footprint by over 90%
- Published paper titled [Hands-off Model Integration in Spatial Index Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16411) @ VLDB, 2020
